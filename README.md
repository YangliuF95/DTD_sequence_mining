# DTD_sequence_mining


## Repository structure
This is the repository for the article "Exploring temporal dynamics in digital trace data: mining user-sequences for communication research" and contains the following elements:
  
- **Code ‚úî**: contains Python and R code used to wrangle, analyze, and visualize the data described in our manuscript, including six approaches: 
    - (1) sequence analysis,
    - (2) event history analysis,
    - (3) hidden Markov models,
    - (4) network analysis,
    - (5) process mining models,
    - (6) language-based models.
- **Figures ‚úî**: includes visualizations generated from our analyses. 
- **Data ‚ùì**: Due to the sensitive nature of our dataset, we are unable to provide direct access to the data used in this study. We include a detailed description in the manuscript and encourage researchers to apply our framework and code to your own datasets.

## Studying digital trace data as user-sequences 

In this study, we propose a new **research framework** enabled by **the exploding supply of digital trace data (DTD)**, alongside **various approaches to analyzing them**. 
- We define our framework as an analytical scheme that *chronologically* orders user interactions with the media environment into one dimension and employs computational approaches to explore the inter-activity dependence that considers individual activities in the contexts of other activities.
- Specifically, it represents the evolving user activities on digital platforms as user-sequences, which provide detailed information about user activity with high temporal resolution (see the Figure below for an example of the proposed individual-level representation).
